# Code Quality Standards

## General Best Practices
1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Extract common patterns into reusable functions
2. **SOLID Principles** - Follow where applicable
3. **Clean Code** - Meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility
4. **Error Handling** - Always handle errors explicitly and meaningfully
5. **Performance** - Consider performance implications, add comments for O(n) complexity

### Security Considerations
1. Never hardcode sensitive information
2. Validate all inputs
3. Sanitize outputs when dealing with user data
4. Use proper authentication and authorization checks
5. Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications

### Version Control
1. Write clear, imperative commit messages
2. Keep commits atomic and focused
3. Reference issue numbers where applicable
4. Never commit commented-out code without explanation

## Code Review Checklist
When reviewing or writing code, ensure:
- [ ] All new functions have proper documentation
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Error handling is explicit and helpful
- [ ] Performance implications are considered
- [ ] Security concerns are addressed
- [ ] Code follows language-specific idioms
- [ ] Debug statements use proper formatting
- [ ] Documentation includes examples where helpful
- [ ] Existing functionality is preserved or improved

## Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update dependencies
- Refactor when patterns emerge
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md
- Keep README.md up-to-date
- Add migration guides for breaking changes
