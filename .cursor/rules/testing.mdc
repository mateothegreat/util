## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
1. **Generate test coverage for ALL new functionality** - no exceptions
2. Tests must cover:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Boundary values
   - Concurrent access (where applicable)

### Test Quality Standards
1. **Idempotency**: All tests MUST be idempotent - running them multiple times should produce the same result
2. **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on external state or other tests
3. **Clarity**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Performance**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

### Test Review Process
- Re-evaluate existing test coverage when modifying code
- Re-implement tests if they:
  - Don't guarantee idempotency
  - Are potentially problematic or flaky
  - Could be improved with better approaches
  - Don't cover new edge cases introduced by changes
